# Learning Concurrency in Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Learning Concurrency in Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-concurrency-python-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789134346), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Python is a very high-level, general-purpose language that is utilized heavily in fields such as data science and research, as well as being one of the top choices for general-purpose programming for programmers around the world. It features a wide number of powerful, high- and low-level libraries and frameworks that complement its delightful syntax and enable Python programmers to be creative.

This course introduces some of the most popular libraries and frameworks and goes in-depth into how you can leverage these libraries for your own high-concurrent, highly-performant Python programs. We'll cover the fundamental concepts of concurrency needed to be able to write your own concurrent and parallel software systems in Python.

The course will guide you down the path to mastering Python concurrency, giving you all the necessary hardware and theoretical knowledge. We'll cover concepts such as debugging and exception handling as well as some of the most popular libraries and frameworks that allow you to create event-driven and reactive systems. By the end of the video course, you'll have learned techniques to write incredibly efficient concurrent systems that follow best practices.
